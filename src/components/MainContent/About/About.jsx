            S.P College, the oldest and premier institute of higher education in
            Kashmir embodies a history of 107 years of its glorious past. It was
            established in 1905, as an intermediate college by upgrading the
            famous Hindu high school, Srinagar. It was the personal effort of
            notable British social reformer and educationist, Dr. Annie Besant
            who directed the central Hindu college trust, Benares (to which it
            was affiliated) to appoint, Mr. M.u. Moore, a noted Irish scholar as
            the first principal of the institution. Beginning with a modest roll
            of eight students and only six teachers on its staff, in a few
            yearsâ€™ time, the college rose to the degree level in arts by 1911
            when state government took it over and renamed it Sri Pratap College
            after the name of the then ruler of the state maharaja Pratap Singh.
            In 1912 the college was affiliated to the Punjab University, Lahore
            with state patronage available to it by virtue of which the growth
            of S.P. College received a notable fillip. Ever since, the
            development of the college has been a steady process persisting
            through the entire span of the 20th century.

            During the tenure of prof. I.K. Sharga (1911-1921) the science
            stream up to the intermediate level was introduced in the college
            curriculum. The dynamic and ablest academics and administrator like
            prof. M. U. Moore, prof. Vinamali Chakarvati, prof. Jia Lal Kaul and
            prof. Saif-ud-din have served the college and contributed to the
            level that the hundreds of the college alumni rose to eminence in
            different fields of human activity in the state, by occupying
            important positions.
